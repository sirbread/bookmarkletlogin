i didn't want to waste like 10 seconds every time i logged into my school portal so i wasted 2 hours making this instead

## use
1. make a bookmark
2. copy/paste the code into the url field (every part of it, yes)
3. edit the username and password
4. get on my school portal login
5. click and watch you get magically logged in
<br>
this will most likely **_not_** work with your school's login portal, as this one hunts for specific div names <br>
idk if this deserves its own repo atp ðŸ¥€ðŸ¥€
